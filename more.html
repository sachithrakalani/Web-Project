            <p>Pizza was consumed by ancient Egyptian Romans and Greeks. The modern birthplace
                of pizza is Southwestern Italy’s Campania region, home to the city of Naples. Founded

            <h1>Pizza types</h1> <br>

            <p>Neapolitan pizza (pizza napoletana): Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are made with
                local ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to
                the south of Mount Vesuvius, and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, made with the milk
                from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild
                state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of
                origin).<a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/qual/it/147_it.htm" id="ref">[3]</a> According
                to the rules proposed by the Associazione Verace</p><br>

            <P>Pizza Napoletana <a href="http://www.verapizzanapoletana.org/vpn/vpn_frames-index.htm" id="ref">[4]</a>,
                the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of Italian
                wheat
                flour (type 0 or 00, or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast,
                salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making
                rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by
                hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed
                by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than
                3 mm (¹⁄₈ in) thick. The pizza must be baked for 60–90 seconds in a 485 °C (905 °F)
                stone oven with an oak-wood fire.<a href="http://www.verapizzanapoletana.org/vpn/vpn_frames-index.htm"
                    id="ref">[5]</a></P><br>

            <p>When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. Neapolitan pizza has
                been given the status of a "guaranteed traditional specialty" in Italy. This allows
                only three official variants: pizza marinara, which is made with tomato, garlic,
                oregano and extra virgin olive oil (although most Neapolitan pizzerias also add basil
                to the marinara), pizza Margherita, made with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and
                extra-virgin olive oil, and pizza Margherita extra made with tomato, mozzarella from
                Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil.</p><br>

            <p><b>
                    Lazio style: Pizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy, <br>is available
                    in two different styles:</b>
            <p style="text-align: left;">(1) Take-away shops sell pizza rustica or pizza al taglio.
                This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2
                cm). The crust is similar to that of an English muffin, and the pizza is often cooked in
                an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight.</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">(2) In pizza restaurants (pizzerias), pizza is served in a dish in its
                traditional round
                shape.
                It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style
                base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and
                texture. In Rome, a pizza napoletana is topped with tomato, mozzarella,
                anchovies and oil (thus, what in Naples is called pizza romana, in Rome is called
                pizza napoletana).</p>
            </p><br>

            <p><b>Types of Lazio-style pizza include:</b></p> <br>

            <p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Pizza romana (in Naples): tomato, mozzarella, anchovies, oregano, oil;
            </p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Pizza viennese: tomato, mozzarella, German sausage, oregano, oil;</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Pizza capricciosa ("capricious pizza"): mozzarella, tomato, mushrooms,
                artichokes, cooked ham, olives, oil (in
                Rome, prosciutto raw ham is used and half a hard-boiled egg is added);</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Pizza quattro stagioni ("four seasons pizza"): same ingredients for the
                capricciosa, but ingredients not mixed;</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Pizza quattro formaggi ("four cheese pizza"): tomatoes, mozzarella,
                stracchino,
                fontina, gorgonzola (sometimes ricotta can be swapped for one of the last three);</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Sicilian-style pizza has its toppings baked directly into the crust. An
                authentic
                recipe uses neither cheese nor anchovies. ("Sicilian" pizza in the United States is
                typically a different variety of product, made with a thick crust characterized by a
                rectangular shape and topped with tomato sauce, cheese and optional toppings.
                Pizza Hut's "Sicilian Pizza", introduced in 1994, is not an authentic example of the
                style as only garlic, basil, and oregano are mixed into the crust);</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• White pizza (pizza bianca) omits the tomato sauce, often substituting pesto
                or
                dairy products such as sour cream.<br>
                Most commonly, especially on the East coast of the United States, the toppings
                consist only of mozzarella and ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil and spices like
                fresh basil and garlic. In Rome, the term pizza bianca refers to a type of bread
                topped with olive oil, salt and, occasionally, rosemary sprigs. It is also a Roman style
                to bottom the white pizza with figs, the result being known as pizza e fichi (pizza
                with figs);
            </p><br>
            <p style="text-align: left;">• Ripieno or calzone is a turnover-style pizza filled with several ingredients,
                such as
                ricotta, salami and mozzarella, and folded over to form a half circle before being
                baked. In Italian calzone literally means "large sock", while the word ripieno actually
                means just "filling" and does not by itself imply a form of pizza.</p><br>

            <h1> Non-Italian types of pizza </h1> <br>

            <p> In the 20th century pizza has become an international food with widely varying
                toppings. These pizzas consist of the same basic design but include an exceptionally
                diverse choice of ingredients.</p><br>

            <P><b>Pizza in Australia </b></P>
            <p style="text-align: left;">The usual Italian varieties are available, but there is also the Australian, or
                australiana, which has the usual tomato sauce base and mozzarella cheese with
                bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Prawns are also
                sometimes used on this style of pizza.<br>In the 1980s Australian pizza shops and restaurants began
                selling gourmet pizzas,
                pizzas with upmarket ingredients such as salmon, dill, bocconcini, tiger prawns, and
                such unconventional toppings as kangaroo, emu and crocodile. Wood-fired pizzas,
                cooked in a ceramic oven heated by wood fuel, are also popular.</p>


            <P><b>Pizza in Brazil </b></P>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Pizza was brought by Italian immigrants to that country. São Paulo, calling
                itself
                "The Pizza Capital of the World", has 6000 pizza establishments and 1.4 million
                pizzas are consumed daily.<a href="http://indexet.gazetamercantil.com.br/
                arquivo/2007/07/10/330/Capital-da-pizza,-sabores-para-todos.html" id="ref">[6]</a> It is said that the
                first Brazilian pizzas were
                baked in
                the Brás district of São Paulo in the early part of the 20th century. Until the 1950s,
                they were only found in the Italian communities. Since then, pizza became
                increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional
                pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga and Bela Vista.
                Typically, pizzas follow the Neapolitan variety, rather than the Roman one, being
                thicker and more doughy and oftentimes lacking tomato sauce.</p>


            <P><b>Pizza in India</b></P>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Pizza is a emerging fast food in Indian urban areas. With the arrival of
                branded
                pizza, it has reached to many cities. Pizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian
                based toppings like Tandoori Chicken and Paneer. Indian pizzas are generally made
                more spicy as compared to their western counterparts, to suit Indian taste. Along
                with Indian variations, more conventional pizzas are also eaten.</p>



            <P><b>Pizza in Pakistan</b></P>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Pizza was introduced in Pakistan in 1993. A Mr. Manzar Riaz from Lahore is
                credited
                with introducing it to Pakistan when he opened up the country's first pizza outlet.
                Pizza Hut opened its outlets in Pakistan in 1993 which was three years before India
                had its first Pizza Hut outlet in 1996. Unlike in India where the pizza has become
                widely popular, the pizza in Pakistan is only popular and well known only in the
                liberal provinces of Punjab, Sindh and Kashmir. The pizza is still virtually
                unknown in the conservative provinces of North-West Frontier Province and
                Baluchistan.<a
                    href="http://www.allbusiness.com/food-beverage/restaurants-food-service-restaurants-fast/8006760-1.html"
                    id="ref">[7]</a> <br> <br>
                As of 2009, Pizza sales in Pakistan generate over $2 billion annually, which is the
                second largest pizza sales revenue after the US. Pakistan has the world's largest
                Pizza Hut store in Karachi with a seating capacity of over 5,000 people</p>


            <P><b>United States styles and specialties</b></P>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Due to the wide influence of Italian and Greek immigrants in American culture,
                the
                US has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance
                to the Italian original. Both thick and thin crust are popular.</p>


            <div class="content" id="more01">

                <h1> Frozen and ready-to-bake pizzas </h1> <br>

                <p>Pizza is available frozen. Food technologists have developed ways to overcome
                    challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and
                    producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. Modified
                    corn starch is commonly used as a moisture barrier between the sauce and crust.
                    Traditionally the dough is pre-baked and other ingredients are also sometimes
                    precooked. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising
                    crusts. A form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This
                    pizza is created fresh using raw ingredients, then sold to customers to bake in their
                    own ovens and microwaves.</P>

                    amount of salt for an adult.<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7050585.stm"

                <p>European nutrition research on the eating habits of people with cancer of the
                    mouth, oesophagus, throat or colon showed those who ate pizza at least once a week
                    had less chance of developing cancer, they found. Dr Silvano Gallus, of the Mario
                    Negri Institute for Pharmaceutical Research in Milan,<a
                        href="http://www.marionegri.it/mn/en/index.html" id="ref">[14]</a> who led the
                    research said:
                    "We knew that tomato sauce could offer protection against certain tumors, but we
                    did not expect pizza as a complete meal also to offer such protective powers." Nicola
                    O'Connor, of Cancer Research UK, told BBC News Online: "This study is interesting
                    and the results should probably be looked at in the context of what we already know
                    about the Mediterranean diet and its association with a lower risk of certain types of
                    cancer</p>
                <p>"The secret is probably lycopene, an antioxidant chemical in tomatoes, which is
                    thought to offer some protection against cancer, and which gives the fruit its red
                    color."</p>
                <p>"But before people start dialing the local pizza takeaway, they should consider that
                    some pizzas can be high in saturated fat, salt and calories". In contrast to the classic
                    Italian pizza used in the research, most UK pizza takeaway varieties are often loaded
                    with high fat cheeses and fatty meats and yeast, a high intake of which can
                    contribute to obesity, itself a risk factor for cancer. "Our advice is to enjoy selected
                    Italian pizza (i.e., healthy pizza) in moderation as part of a balanced diet that
                    includes plenty of vegetables and fruit."</p>
                <p>Italian Carlo La Vecchia, a Milan-based epidemiologist said Italian pizza lovers
                    should not see the research as a license to indulge their fondness for pizza food.
                    "There is nothing to indicate that pizza is the only thing responsible for these
                    results." He continued: "Pizza could simply be indicative of a lifestyle and food
                    habits, in other words the Italian version of a Mediterranean diet." A Mediterranean diet is rich in
                    olive oil, fiber, vegetables, fruit, flour and freshly cooked food -
                    including traditional Italian healthy pizza.</p>

                <p> The largest pizza was at the Norwood Pick 'n Pay hypermarket in Johannesburg,
                    South Africa. According to the Guinness Book of Records the pizza was 37.4 meters
                    in diameter and was made using 500 kg of flour, 800 kg of cheese and 900 kg of
                    tomato puree. This was accomplished on December 8, 1990.<a

                <p> The most expensive pizza was made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla, which
                    included toppings such as sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon,
                    medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster marinated in the finest cognac and
                    champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was sold at auction for charity for £2,150.<a
